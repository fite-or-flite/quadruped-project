# quadruped-project
quadruped made from hobby servos and cardboard.
components:
-arduino uno r3
-HiLetgo PCA9685 16 Channel 12-Bit PWM Servo Motor Driver (replaced sunfounder servo shield, which caught on fire)
-12 9g servo motors
-4xAA battery pack

Robot is almost too heavy for it's own weight.  Lighter power source would be better, but it's what I had available.
Multiple iterations of code, trying to work out leg movements on my own (without internet help).  Would probably work better if I utilized arduino timers, but I haven't worked that out yet.

Uploading all iterations for reference.  Last file uploaded is current version.
